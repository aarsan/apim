# Demo Environment or Workflow Diagrams for API Management Use-cases in Financial Services 

In this example scenario, we have a fictitious insurance company, Acme Insurance Company, that provides auto and pet insurance. They have a reseller program which allows anyone to sell their insurance for them and make a commission. To the resellers, Acme provides a website where they can log into to purchase insurance and manage their claims. This works well for smaller resellers but many of them already have a system in place and having to disrupt their flow and use another system to make claims will not work for them. Acme provides an API that can be used for integrating with existing claims processing systems.

## Use Case
Acme Insurance signs up new resellers, sells policies, and  processes claims everyday. The resellers are located all over the United States. Both the website as well as the API need to be up and running 24/7/365.
